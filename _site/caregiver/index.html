<p>Asobo provides a learning quiz, in the form of games, that can be accessed through our App. Users participate in quizzes presented on the screen in the form of single or multiple line/choice questions. Quizzes may or may not include media such as images, audio or video files only meant for educational and learning purposes.</p><hr><hr>

<h3 style="color:DodgerBlue;">PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>

<p>“Personal Information” is information that identifies an individual or relates to an identifiable person, including:<br>

•   First Name<br>
•   Last name<br>
•   Email address (required)<br>
•   Company or organization (of work-related users)<br>
•   School or university (of users)<br>
•   Username and password for Asobo account (required)<br>
•   Profile picture<br>
We may need to collect and process Personal Information marked as ‘required’ to provide the requested Services to you, or because we are legally required to do so. If you do not provide the information that we request, we may not be able to provide the requested Services.<br>

If you submit any Personal Information relating to other people to us or to our service providers regarding the Services, you represent that you have the authority to do so and to permit us to use the information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.<br></p><hr><hr>

<h3 style="color:DodgerBlue;">Personal Information We May Collect</h3>
<p>
•  In order to be able to complete quizzes, a user (“accountholder”) must register email address through our App. As described in more detail below, we may collect, use and disclose Personal Information from accountholders. An “accountholder” is a U.S. user who is age 13 or older or a user from outside the U.S. who is age 16 or older.
<br>
•  Our information practices are different with respect to younger users. Specifically, when a U.S. user who is under the age of 13 or a user from outside the U.S. who is under the age of 16 creates an account (a “child accountholder”), we collect his or her email address only for the purpose of providing password reminders to him or her. Asobo also collects a user name and password which are used for login purposes only.<br></p><hr><hr>

<h3 style="color:DodgerBlue;">How We May Collect Personal Information</h3>
<p>
• We and our service providers may collect Personal Information from accountholders in a variety of ways, including:<br>

<h3 style="color:DodgerBlue;">OTHER INFORMATION</h3>
<p>
Other Information We May Collect:<br>

“Other Information” is any information that does not reveal your specific identity or does not directly relate to an individual, such as:<br>

 

• Browser and device information<br>
• App usage data<br>
• Information collected through cookies, pixel tags and other technologies<br>
• Demographic information and other information provided by you<br>
• Aggregated information<br>
• If we are required to treat Other Information as Personal Information under applicable law, then we may use it for the purposes for which we use and disclose Personal Information as detailed in this Policy.<br></p><hr><hr>

<h3 style="color:DodgerBlue;">How We May Collect Other Information</h3>
<p>
We and our third-party service providers may collect Other Information in a variety of ways, including:<br>

• <u>Through your browser or device:</u> Certain information is collected by most browsers or automatically through your device, such as your Media Access Control (MAC) address, computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, operating system name and version, device manufacturer and model, language, Internet browser type and version and the name and version of the Services (such as the App) you are using. We use this information to ensure that the Services function properly.<br>

• <u>Through your use of the App:</u> When you download and use the App, we and our service providers may track and collect App usage data, such as the date and time the App on your device accesses our servers and what information has been downloaded to the App based on your device number.<br>

• <u>Using cookies:</u> Cookies are pieces of information stored directly on the computer that you are using. Cookies allow us to collect information such as browser type, time spent on the Services, pages visited, language preferences, and other anonymous traffic data.<br>
•  We and our service providers use the information only to support the internal operations of the Services, such as for security purposes, to facilitate navigation, to display information more effectively, to personalize your experience while using the Services and to recognize your computer to assist your use of the Services.<br>
•  We also gather statistical information about use of the Services to continually improve their design and functionality, understand how they are used and assist us with resolving questions regarding them.<br>

• If you do not want information collected using cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to automatically decline cookies or be given the choice of declining or accepting the transfer to your computer of a cookie (or cookies) from a site. You may also wish to refer to http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html.<br>
•  If, however, you do not accept cookies, you may experience some inconvenience in your use of the Services. For example, we may not be able to recognize your computer, and you may need to log in every time you visit.<br>

•<u> Analytics:</u> We may use third parties, including Google Analytics, which use cookies and similar technologies to collect and analyze information about use of the Services and report on activities and trends. You can learn about Google’s practices by going to www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/, and opt out of them by downloading the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on, available at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.<br>

• <u>IP Address:</u> Your IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). An IP address may be identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever a user accesses the Services, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that were visited. <br>
• Collecting IP addresses is standard practice and is done automatically by many websites, applications and other services. We use IP addresses for the purposes of providing support for the internal operations of the Services, such as calculating usage levels, diagnosing server problems, and administering the Services. We may also derive your approximate, general, location from your IP address.<br>

• From you: Information such as communications preference may be collected from accountholders when they voluntarily provide it.<br>

• By aggregating information: Aggregated Personal Information does not personally identify you or any other user of the Services.<br>
</p><hr><hr>
<h3 style="color:DodgerBlue;">How We May Use and Disclose Other Information</h3>
<p>
We may use and disclose Other Information for any purpose, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law. In some instances, we may combine Other Information with Personal Information. If we do, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information as long as it is combined.<br></p><hr><hr>

<h3 style="color:DodgerBlue;">OUR COLLECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION FROM CHILDREN</h3>
<p>
• When a user who is under the age of 13 (for U.S. users) or 16 (for non-U.S. users) creates an account (a “child accountholder”), we collect his or her email address only for the purpose of providing password reminders to him or her. We immediately and permanently alter the email address such that it can only be used as a password reminder and cannot be reconstructed into its original form or used to contact the child accountholder.<br>

• We also collect a user name and password from child accountholders, which are used for login purposes only, to permit the child accountholder to use the Services.<br>

• We and our service providers also collect the information described above, under “Other Information,” from accountholders. This includes Google’s use of certain persistent identifiers to collect information about the use of our Services for analytics purposes only.<br>
